What's the difference between CNN and RNN?
The main difference between a CNN and RNN is the ability to process temporal
information - data that comes in sequences, such as a sentence. Recurrent
neural networks are designed for this very purpose, while convolutional neural
networks are incapable of effectively interpreting temporal information. As a
result, CNNs and RNNs are used for completely distinct purposes, and there are
differences in the structures of the neural networks themselves to fit those
different use cases.
