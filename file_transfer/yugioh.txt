The DT print of Elemental HERO Stratos is really important, because its
behavior over the last few days is likely to become a repeating pattern for
other DT Parallel Commons in Hidden Arsenal: Chapter 1. Starting at a Market
Price of about 4 dollars, Stratos doubled in price late last week and was then
bought out entirely. Now the lowest listings for Near Mint copies are around
the $20 mark, with only 10 listings as of this writing, scaling up to $25.
Waboku was bought out in a similar timeframe, and actually sat with no
listings at all for hours at a time this week. Lots of sellers haven't
realized that HAC1 DT Commons are trending right now, so prices have been all
over the place, but any copies of Waboku under $5 seem to be getting bought
up. At this moment, there are only two Near Mints: one at $3.50 from a newer
seller with low feedback count, and another from an experienced seller for
$10.
Both of these cards have real reasons to be popular, and both could wind up
gaining more value from where they are right now: Stratos is one of the most
popular tournament cards of all time, defining past eras of competition and
still seeing play in modern Hero builds. Waboku sees play in numerous
throwback Time Wizard formats too, especially Goat Format, which is known to
drive demand for vanity printings of older cards.
